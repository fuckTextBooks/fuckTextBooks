Auto searches libgen for course materials for UofT students


Makes use of the uoftbookstore's service to show all course materials, then searchs the isbns through libgenapi and returns the links for each book.

You just enter your UTORID credentials and it should return a list of links from libgen to download them. If it errors, just re-run it. Hopefully my setup file works, I didn't do any testing on that.

Have fun :)
